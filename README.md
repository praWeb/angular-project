# angular-project

This basic version of code will help you with setting up the front end minimal architecture for an enterprise application.

Here we are using both requireJs and angularJs in building this. In general when we use angularJs.. declaration of ng-app
is quite natural, but due to which we cannot have multiple files to modularize the code. So here, we will use appModule 
using which we can organize our code in an modular fashion, which is the most important one for enterprise applications
